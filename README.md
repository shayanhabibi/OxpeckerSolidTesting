## Testing Oxpecker Solid patterns

The files demonstrate how certain manipulations and hacks effect the JSX transpilation to
achieve the following:

1. Define a custom component
2. Provide custom typed properties
3. Write the component in Oxpecker Solid style
4. Access the properties passed to the component in a type safe manner
5. Be able to use that custom component in both functional style AND oxpecker style

This was an absolute joy to do and I love the outcome.
Unfortunately, it's very hacky. But I'm totally okay with that for this amazing potential.
